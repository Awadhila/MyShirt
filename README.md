# MyShirt

**Description:** The MyShirt web app is an immersive and interactive application that allows users to create personalized shirts and caps by selecting various parameters such as color, pattern, and adding custom images. Built on the React framework, the web app utilizes Tailwind CSS for responsive styling and Three.js for advanced 3D capabilities.

## Key Features:

- **3D Visualization:** MyShirt incorporates Three.js to provide a realistic 3D visualization component. Users can interact with virtual representations of shirts and caps, previewing their customized products from different angles.

- **Color Selection:** Users have the flexibility to choose colors for their shirts and caps using a color picker or predefined palette. The app applies chosen colors to the 3D visualization in real-time, providing immediate visual feedback.

- **Pattern Selection:** MyShirt offers a diverse collection of patterns for shirts and caps. Users can explore and apply these patterns to their products, seamlessly adapting them to the corresponding 3D models.

- **Image Upload:** For further personalization, users can upload custom images. MyShirt supports image file uploads, enabling users to add graphics, logos, or designs to their products.

- **Real-Time Preview:** The web app provides a live preview of the customization process. As users make selections and personalize their shirts and caps, the 3D visualization dynamically updates to reflect changes, showcasing colors, patterns, and uploaded images in real-time.

- **Responsive Design:** MyShirt features a responsive design with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

- **Customization Controls:** Intuitive buttons, sliders, and dropdown menus make customization effortless, enabling users to interact with 3D models effortlessly.
